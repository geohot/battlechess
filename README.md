# battlechess

### A decentralized chess tournament using GitHub and Travis CI.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geohot/battlechess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geohot/battlechess) **Click the CI link for the latest battle results**

Currently, the engine makes random moves. Fork this, modify get_move in engine.py, and join the battle! play.py uses the GitHub API to look for forks on this repo, so once you fork it you are registered as a competitor.

The idea isn't to modify stockfish, it's to write clever short python algorithms. Will add checks for running time and code shortness soon. And if there's cheating, I'll add a sandbox. If you want to use a Python library, send a pull request to modify requirements.txt and we can discuss if it's fair.

You have at most 100ms to make your move. Go over, and you forfeit the match.
